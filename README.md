# Cheapest Flight Price Tracker

**This project simplifies the process of finding the cheapest flights from a particular city by utilizing internet searches and dynamically updating a Google Sheet with relevant details.**

**Users can specify IATA airport codes, a start and end date for the search, and the system will populate a Google Sheet with city names, corresponding IATA codes, and the minimum cost of flights in euros during the specified time frame.**

**Key Features:**

1. **IATA Code Input:**
   - Users provide IATA airport codes (e.g., NYC for New York) as input parameters, enabling targeted searches for the cheapest flights.

2. **Date Range Specification:**
   - The project allows users to define a start and end date for the flight search, ensuring results are confined to the desired time frame.

3. **Google Sheet Logging:**
   - The system updates a Google Sheet with three columns: City, IATA Codes, and the minimum cost of flights from that city (in euros). This provides users with a centralized view of the most affordable travel options.

4. **Interactive Flight Information Retrieval:**
